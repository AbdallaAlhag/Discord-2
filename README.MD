- [ ] - [x]
### todo: 
        - [ ] - [x]
        do this near the end:
        - [ ] fake data works well with front end but does not work with backend unless i update with my temp backend data
            - [ ] add fake data to backend and use that instead
        - [ ] change id in prisma from autoincrement to uuid
        

        - [ ] Adding friend is not real time but i think that's okay, we can fix it later, not a priority 
        - [ ] typing real time indicator works but not read receipts just yet. Both could use a tune up, do later, extra  
        - [x] create server active: got hover to work but not active
        - [x] invite sending and both are embedded but link embeds after refresh.
            - [ ] invite code is pretty useless, don't know how to do anything with it.
            - [ ] work on expired or deleted servers
            - [ ] fix links embeds after refresh 
        - [ ] work on server menu
            - [ ] Complete the rest of the server menu later
        - [ ] work on chat:
            - [ ] make the chat look like discord: add time hover over message to show time
            - [ ] server chat still little bugged but kinda annoying to fix 
        - [ ] register page background is pretty slow sometimes
        - [x] Work on gif picker, make it a modal and work on opening and closing it. 
            - [x] make sure it works with messaging (.gifs work)
                - [ ] make sure it works with other types
            - [ ] try to get stickers working
            - [ ] Add loaders to values (already have loader but i like the square ones better)
            - [ ] stickers are not working? i guess and its okay for now.
        - [ ] Create channel is not real time, just needs a refresh
        to see it.
        - [ ] server chat is not real time?
        - [ ] change invite if already joined
        - [ ] when clicking on server, should get users in voice channels
        - [ ] voice channel is based on server channel text group not voice group
    
        - [ ] pause execution on webrtc development at the moment
            - [ ] fix not active on user screens and correct the amount of people in voice room
        - [ ] Get voiceChanneldisplay working properly
            - [x] get all buttons to work in serverchannelsidebar - - [ ] voice display
        - [ ] create that green border hover when voice is activated
