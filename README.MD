    npx kill-port 3000 to kill server if already in use


    todo:
        - fake data works well with front end but does not work with backend unless i update with my temp backend data
            - add fake data to backend and use that instead
        - change id in prisma from autoincrement to uuid
        - create server tooltip when hover on server icon and white left line
        - Adding friend is not real time but i think that's okay, we can fix it later, not a priority 
        - typing real time indicator works but not read receipts just yet. Both could use a tune up  
        - invite sending and both are embedded but link embeds after refresh.
            - fix copy link issue
            - Work on accepting invite       
            - invite code is pretty useless, don't know how to do anything with it. 
        - work on server menu
            - Complete the rest of the server menu later
        - work on some styling:
            - make the chat look like discord
