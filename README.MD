    todo:
        - fake data works well with front end but does not work with backend unless i update with my temp backend data
        - change id in prisma from autoincrement to uuid
        - create server tooltip when hover on server icon and white left line
        - Adding friend is not real time but i think that's okay, we can fix it later, not a priority 
        - typing real time indicator works but not read receipts just yet. Both could use a tune up  
        - invite sending but not embedded and not real time
